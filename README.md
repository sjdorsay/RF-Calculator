# RF-Calculator
A desktop application supporting multiple RF design calculators including trace width/impedance, attenuator resistances, and prototype filter implementations.

This was created using Visual Studio 2019Version 16.11.2. At present I intend to complete the basic functionality of the filter portion for now it has limited functionality.

In the near future I will be working on,
1. Completing the basic functionality of the filter
- Create images for the stepped impedance, lumped, etc.
- Update the coupled-line filter
- Add quarter-wave stub, and gap-coupled resonator
2. Finish report generation for transmission line
3. Implement report generation for attenuator
- Display attenuation variation
- Display return loss variation
- Display approximate max input power
4. Create "help" documentation
5. Add functionality to help buttons

In the far future, if there is enough interest, I will be working on
1. Add phase shifter
2. Add power divider
3. IP3 / IM
