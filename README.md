# RF-Calculator
A desktop application supporting multiple RF design calculators including trace width/impedance, attenuator resistances, and prototype filter implementations.

This was created using Visual Studio 2019 Version 16.11.2. At present I intend to complete the basic functionality of the filter portion for now it has limited functionality.

In the near future I will be working on,
- [x] Completing the basic functionality of the filter
- Create images for the stepped impedance, lumped, etc.
- Update the coupled-line filter
- Add quarter-wave stub, and gap-coupled resonator
- [x] Finish report generation for transmission line
- [x] Implement report generation for attenuator
- Display attenuation variation
- Display return loss variation
- Display approximate max input power
- [x] Create "help" documentation
- [x] Add functionality to help buttons
- [ ] Export SQLite database with tool publishing

If there is enough interest, I will be working on the following
- [ ] Add phase shifter
- [ ] Add power divider
- [ ] IP3 / IM
